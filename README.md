## Background 
The challenge is to create a dashboard for users to select their ID, and the dashboard will present the result of their summary demographic data, a bar chart showing their 10 most abundant bacteria, a gauge chart showing their belly button wash frequency, and a bubble chart showing the OTU IDs in relation to their sample values for each OTU. 

The finished dashboard is also published through Github pages.  

The below screenshot shows the launch page.
