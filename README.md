## Background 
The challenge is to create a dashboard for users to select their ID, and the dashboard will present the result of their summary demographic data, a bar chart showing their 10 most abundant bacteria, a gauge chart showing their belly button wash frequency, and a bubble chart showing the OTU IDs in relation to their sample values for each OTU. 

The dashboard should show the information in relation to the first person (ID #940) upon launch. 

The finished dashboard is also published through Github pages.  

The below screenshot shows the launch page.
